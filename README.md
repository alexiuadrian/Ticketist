# Ticketist

Ticket-Based Support Web Application for multiple Organizations

Ticketist offers a way for Organizations to implement a way of sorting and categorizing Issues (Tickets) within that Organization.
A particular user can see, sort, search, create, update, delete and comment on Tickets from within their Organization.

There are four roles
 - Admin (CanManageOrganizations)
 - Project Manager (CanManageProjects)
 - Supervisor (CanManageTeams)
 - User (CanManageTickets)
 
 The Admin can see the existing Organizations and add/edit/delete Organizations. The Admin can also modify user roles and delete users.
 The Project Manager can see the existing Projects and add/edit/delete Projects from within the Organization he is working for.
 The Supervisor can see the existing Teams and add/edit/delete Teams from within the Organization he is working for and the Project he is assigned to.
 The User can see the existing Tickets and add/edit/delete and comment on Tickets from within the Organization he is working for, the Project he is assigned to and the Team he is   part of.
